# Computational-Geometry
During the 3rd semester of my studies, I had a subject called Computational Geometry.

Here you can see the programs I've made for these classes:

- **[Task 1](./Task_1)** 
  - The purpose of this task was to find out, using two methods, on which side of a segment the point is.
  - Stack: React (styledComponents) + JavaScript (decimal.js, gsap3), CSS, HTML
- **[Task 2](./Task_2)**
  - The main purpose of this task was to calculate the coordinates of the point where two segments intersect (or the lines would intersect).
  - Stack: C++ (Qt 5_15, QtWidgets), CMake
