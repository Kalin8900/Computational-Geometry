### The main purpose of this task was to calculate the coordinates of the point where two segments intersect (or the lines would intersect)

----

### Also it was required to create a GUI that carries out tasks such as:

- [x] Possibility of entering data from the keyboard and reading data
from a text file and also be able to save the results to a text file.
- [x] Create a graphic presentation of the analyzed points and segments along with their intersection point
- [x] The first presentation should be adjusted to the visibility of all points
- [x] Points in the drawing should be marked with their markings (A, B, C, D, P)
- [x] It should be possible to configure drawing parameters, i.e .: colors, line thicknesses, styles, visibility, hide point markings.
